## hello there 👋

you're probably looking for [bkataru](http://github.com/bkataru)

`BK-Modding` was my old moniker on the big web that i've used since my early days of modding for the GTA series of games

i've since retired that username and go by `bkataru` these days on most corners of the internet

personally, i'm eternally grateful to GTA and its modding community for getting me into building software and hacking on things all the way back in 6th grade

my journey in software began in 2012-2013 as a noob GTA modder writing script hooks and Visual Basic .NET modules as a hobby because "I yearned to break free from the chains/constraints of the game engine and bring my ideas to life" or so a mental journal entry says

special thanks to [GTA X Scripting - JulioNIB](https://gtaxscripting.blogspot.com/) for personally mentoring and entertaining the endless stupid questions of a clueless early teen, they were patient enough to hold my hand when I was still learning the ropes

shameless plug but please do check out my mods and YT channel from the `BK Modding` era, they're not the best or most refined compared to the ones coming out these days (i was 13 when i made them ;-;) but they're still fun if you like superheroes/MCU/DC and the lot
